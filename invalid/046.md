# Discrepancy between redemption block delay user expects and actual execution of collection

## Summary
The process of burning Ubiquity Dollars to redeem back collateral is in two steps. First, the user creates a request and later collects the request once a certain amount of blocks have passed which is represented as block delay in the system. But instead of assigning the block delay that users need to wait to that specific redeem request in step 1, it is checked against in step 2 (`collectRedemption()`).
## Vulnerability Detail
The block delay wait time is not stored for a specific redeem request upon calling `LibUbiquityPool#redeemDollar()`, but rather it is checked against when we are doing the actual `LibUbiquityPool#collectRedemption()`.

```javascript
        require(
            (
                poolStorage.lastRedeemedBlock[msg.sender].add(
                    poolStorage.redemptionDelayBlocks
                )
            ) <= block.number,
            "Too soon to collect redemption"
        );
```

If Alice makes a redeem and the block delay at the time of request is 50 blocks, if for whatever reason the block delay time is increased after the request is made but *before* collected, she will not be able to collect on the initial time that she should have been able to, as the block delay value that is checked against in the `collectRedemption()` function is a state variable which is subject to change instead of cached upon moment of request. Of course, this is not intentional griefing by the protocol, but there are a variety of reasons for which the protocol might want to change the block delay and that leads to this possible scenario.

The following example scenario is possible when it shouldn't be:

1. Alice takes a `DAI` loan from some other arbitrary protocol
2. She then mints Ubiquity Dollars using her `DAI` as collateral in the `UbiquityPool`
3. She uses the newly minted Ubiquity Dollars in a 3rd protocol to generate yield and make a profit
4. Now she wants to `redeemDollar()` so she can receive back the `DAI` that she put in as collateral in Ubiquity, repay her original loan in time before interest is accrued and be left with some amount of Ubiquty Dollars profit
5. After making a request to redeem, the block delay is not stored for her specific request, and for whatever reason the block delay value is changed while she waits for the delay to pass so she could collect, making it longer than she originally expected
6. Alice tries to `collectRedemption()` but cannot because the block delay was changed, due to this she can't repay her original `DAI` loan on time and now owes accrued interest to that loan instead of being able to repay it and come out of the whole process with a profit as she planned (she could potentially also be at a loss depending on the loan parameters and interest amount accrued)

## Impact
Discrepancy between expected time point at which a user can take back his collateral and actual execution is possible which causes unexpected behavior for the user experience whilst it is easily fixable.

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Add a mapping for `userRedeem => blockDelay` and store the block delay for each redeem request separately instead of comparing to a state variable (which is subject to change) in the final step. That way users are *always* aware of exactly when they can expect to receive back their collateral.
