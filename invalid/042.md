# delegatecall to the  _init  address even when there is no meaningful data to be processed

## Summary
Delegate call made on an  existing `_init` with empty `calldata`

## Vulnerability Detail
According to the EIP
```solidity
If the `_init` value is `address(0)` then `_calldata` execution is skipped. In this case` _calldata` can contain 0 bytes or custom information.
```
In the case the `_init` value is not zero 


` _init`  address represents the contract that contains the initialization logic to be executed.
This initialization performs any necessary setup or configuration from the `_calldata`
The  `_calldata`  parameter represents the input data that will be forwarded to the  `_init`  contract during the `delegatecall` operation. This input data is expected to contain the function selector and any necessary arguments for the initialization function in the ` _init `contract.

If an empty  `calldata`  is sent and the  `initializeDiamondCut`  function proceeds with the `delegatecall` without checking for the empty  `calldata` This will lead to uncessary gas consumption and computational overhead also depending on how the `_init` contract is designed it will lead to unexpected behaviours in the contract logic 
## Impact
the  `_init`  contract may assume the presence of valid input data and attempt to process it, leading to unpredictable results or errors.

## Recommendation
Check if `'calldata` is empty before making the delegate call
