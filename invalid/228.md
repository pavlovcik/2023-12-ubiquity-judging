# User cannot collect redemption even if called the redeem function while redeem was not paused.

## Summary
User cannot collect redemption even if called the redeem function while redeem was not paused. 
## Vulnerability Detail
Lets say Alice redeems 1000 dollars and is now waiting for 1000 blocks to pass before she can collect redemption.

3000 blocks have passed and alice have not collected yet. And redeem functionality is paused.

The user should be able to get their tokens still back because the dollars she held are already burned from her on following line:

```solidity
        ubiquityDollarToken.burnFrom(msg.sender, dollarAmount);
```

So collateral is now backing nothing and is ready to go to Alice but could not due to following lines in collect redemption:

```solidity
        require(
            poolStorage.isRedeemPaused[collateralIndex] == false,
            "Redeeming is paused"
        );
```

this check is for the redeem not for collect redemption.

Alice should be able to collect the redemptions she made when the pool was not paused, it goes against the design principle otherwise. 

## Impact
Tokens are burnt from Alice but she can't get her funds back.

## Recommendation
remove the following lines from `collectRedemption`

```solidity
        require(
            poolStorage.isRedeemPaused[collateralIndex] == false,
            "Redeeming is paused"
        );
```
