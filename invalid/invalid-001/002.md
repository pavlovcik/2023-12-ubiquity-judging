# No minPrice/maxPrice check for Chainlink aggregator

## Summary

No minPrice/maxPrice check for Chainlink aggregator

## Vulnerability Detail

Ubiquity attempts to fetch the price of a collateral token in USD here - https://github.com/ubiquity/ubiquity-dollar/blob/9e41ca5626d7376451f286d04106acead1f9e71d/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol#L539. However, there is no check as to whether the price falls within [minPrice, maxPrice] price range. As a result, when the price falls below minPrice, Chainlink reports minPrice and if it goes above maxPrice, chainlink reports maxPrice resulting in the incorrect price used during calculation.

## Impact

If the price of any of the collateral crashes and falls below minPrice or maxPrice, then the wrong price will be used. The Chainlink oracle is used to determine the value of the Ubiquity dollar in terms of collateral tokens, and this is further used in the mintDollar (COLLATERAL -> UBI) and redeemDollar (UBI -> COLLATERAL) functions. 

So if for instance, LUSD crashes and if LUSD/USD goes below minPrice, then the minPrice will be used so more LUSD tokens will be paid out for every UBI dollar than intended.
