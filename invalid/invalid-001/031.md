# ChainlinkAdapterOracle will return the wrong price for collateral asset if underlying aggregator hits minAnswer

High

## Summary

Chainlink aggregators have a built in circuit breaker if the price of an asset goes outside of a predetermined price band. The result is that if an asset experiences a huge drop in value (i.e. LUNA crash) the price of the oracle will continue to return the minPrice instead of the actual price of the asset. This would allow user to continue borrowing with the asset but at the wrong price. This is exactly what happened to [Venus on BSC when LUNA imploded](https://rekt.news/venus-blizz-rekt/).

## Vulnerability Detail

The ChainlinkAdapterOracle uses the [ChainlinkFeedRegistry](https://etherscan.io/address/0x47Fb2585D2C56Fe188D0E6ec628a38b74fCeeeDf) to obtain the price of the requested tokens.

    return _addPhaseIds(roundId, answer, startedAt, updatedAt, answeredInRound, currentPhaseId);
  }
```
`ChainlinkFeedRegistry#latestRoundData` pulls the associated aggregator and requests round data from it. ChainlinkAggregators have minPrice and maxPrice circuit breakers built into them. This means that if the price of the asset drops below the minPrice, the protocol will continue to value the token at minPrice instead of it's actual value. This will allow users to take out huge amounts of bad debt and bankrupt the protocol.

Example with Ubiquity & LUSD Collateral. 

LUSD price = 1$
minPrice = 0.5$

Black Swan event = price drops to 0.1$
Due to the minPrice, the aggregator still returns 0.5$

Alice buys 1000$ of LUSD = 10_000 LUSD token. 
Alice calls mintDollar for 10_000 LUSD and receives 4950 Dollar (1% minting fee deducted)
Alice swap the 4950 Dollar on the curve Dollar/3pool for USDC and makes around 4800$ in profit.  


## Impact

In the event that an asset crashes (i.e. LUNA) the protocol can be manipulated to give out Dollars at an inflated price of collateral.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

ChainlinkAdapterOracle should check the returned answer against the minPrice/maxPrice and revert if the answer is outside of the bounds:

```diff
        // validation
-        require(answer > 0, "Invalid price");
+        require(answer >= maxPrice && answer <= minPrice, "Invalid price");

        require(
            block.timestamp - updatedAt <
                poolStorage.collateralPriceFeedStalenessThresholds[
                    collateralIndex
                ],
            "Stale data"
        );


```
