# Single Owner Account problem in Leading to Potential TWAP Oracle Manipulation"

## Summary
see vulnerability details 
## Vulnerability Detail
The  contract is designed for the Curve TWAP oracle in the Dollar MetaPool, and contains a critical configuration in the function `setPool.`  cause This function is responsible for setting the `Curve MetaPool` address and it's associated token address. Currently, the function is protected by an `onlyOwner` modifier. While this restricts access to unauthorized users,  but  it poses a significant risk as the contract operates with a single owner account. cause  as  long as the contract is  operates with a single owner account in  the current setup with a single owner that is still  risk cause if the owner account is compromised, the attacker could change the Curve MetaPool address to a malicious one, potentially impacting the TWAP oracle's integrity and it's can manipulate price data
 here is the vulnerable line :
```solidity
 function setPool(
        address _pool,
        address _curve3CRVToken1
    ) external onlyOwner {
        return LibTWAPOracle.setPool(_pool, _curve3CRVToken1);
    }

```
## Impact
If the single owner account is compromised, an attacker gains the ability to change the Curve MetaPool address to a malicious address. This breach could lead to manipulated price data being fed into the TWAP oracle, impacting the integrity of the oracle and potentially leading to severe financial consequences, including but not limited to, incorrect valuation of assets, exploitation of financial operations dependent on the oracle.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 replace the single "god mode" admin at the start with a multisignature wallet for the owner account
