# Possible Loss of Token Due to Lack of Balance check in burn() fucntion

## Summary

If a user calls the `burn` function with an `amount` equal to their entire `token balance`, they would end up with a `zero balance` for that token. This is because the `burn` function reduces the `balance` of the caller's address by the specified `amount` and at the same time, it doesn't check that the user has enough balance to burn

## Vulnerability Detail

Scenario:

The user calls the `burn` function with their entire token balance as the `amount`.

The `burn` function in the contract attempts to decrease the balance of the user's address by `amount.` Since the `amount` is equal to the user's entire token `balance`, this operation succeeds.

The `burn` function then reduces the total supply of tokens by `amount`.

The user's address now has a `balance of zero` for that token.



## Impact

This could be particularly problematic if the user holds other tokens that rely on the token they just burnt. 
For example, if the user is holding tokens for `staking` or `governance voting rights`, burning these tokens could affect their ability to participate in these activities.

## Recommendation


> To mitigate this risk, it's recommended to add a mechanism that prevents users from burning more tokens than they own. This could be done by checking the user's balance before allowing them to call the burn function.
