# In case the EOA and contract who redeemed Dollar and have not collected redemption yet makes a loss, the unclaimedPoolCollateral will be not changed.

## Summary
There are risks associated with EOA and contract who redeemed Dollar and have not collected redemption such as smart contract risks. In case a loss happens, it will not be reflected in the unclaimedPoolCollateral and unclaimedPoolCollateral will be different with real unclaimed collateral in the pool.
## Vulnerability Detail
The amount of unclaimed collateral in the pool is tracked by the unclaimedPoolCollateral variable.
This amount is used to calculate the freeCollateralBalance().

function freeCollateralBalance(
        uint256 collateralIndex
    ) internal view returns (uint256) {
        UbiquityPoolStorage storage poolStorage = ubiquityPoolStorage();
        return
            IERC20(poolStorage.collateralAddresses[collateralIndex])
                .balanceOf(address(this))
                .sub(poolStorage.unclaimedPoolCollateral[collateralIndex]);
    }

When there is a loss to the EOA and contract, there is no way to set the unclaimedPoolCollateral variable.

This leads to an different collateralUsdBallance.
## Impact
The amount of collateralUsdBallance can be lower then the real collateral USD balance.

## Recommendation
Add function to allow admin to set the unclaimedPoolCollateral.

function setUnclaimedPoolCollateral(uint256 collateralIndex, uint256 amount) external only Admin {
  UbiquityPoolStorage storage poolStorage = ubiquityPoolStorage();

  require(amount<=poolStorage.unclaimedPoolCollateral[collateralIndex], "Amount exceeds previous amount");

  poolStorage.unclaimedPoolCollateral[collateralIndex]-=amount;
}
