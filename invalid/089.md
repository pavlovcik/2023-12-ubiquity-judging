# Diamond Proxy Does not delete added faucet due to  wrong implementation.

## Summary
The Diamond Proxy is vulnerable to a scenario where the `LibDiamond::removeFunctions` function incorrectly supports only a zero address for removing functions, rather than allowing the removal of functions associated with a specific faucet address.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the provided test case, the `testCutdoesNotDeleteFaucet` function demonstrates that the removal of functions using `LibDiamond::removeFunctions` is limited to zero addresses, preventing the targeted deletion of functions associated with a specific faucet address.

## Impact
This vulnerability could lead to an inability to effectively manage and remove functions associated with specific faucet addresses, potentially impacting the overall security and functionality of the Diamond Proxy.

##Poc
```solidity
 function testCutdoesNotDeleteFaucet() public {
        FacetCut[] memory facetCut = new FacetCut[](1);
        bytes4[] memory selectors = new bytes4[](2);
        selectors[0] = MockFacetWithStorageWriteFunctions.functionA.selector;
        selectors[1] = MockFacetWithStorageWriteFunctions.functionB.selector;
       
        
        facetCut[0] = FacetCut({
            facetAddress: address(writeFacet),
            action: FacetCutAction.Add,
            functionSelectors: selectors
        });
        vm.prank(owner);
        // 
        diamondCutFacet.diamondCut(facetCut, address(0x0), "");


        FacetCut[] memory facetCut2 = new FacetCut[](1);
        bytes4[] memory selectorss = new bytes4[](2);
        selectorss[0] = MockFacetWithPureFunctions.functionA.selector;
        selectorss[1] = MockFacetWithPureFunctions.functionB.selector;

        facetCut2[0] = FacetCut({
            facetAddress: address(writeFacet),
            action: FacetCutAction.Remove,
            functionSelectors: selectorss
        });

        vm.prank(owner);
        // 
        diamondCutFacet.diamondCut(facetCut2, address(0x0), "");

        vm.expectRevert("Diamond: Function does not exist");
        IMockFacet(address(diamondCutFacet)).functionA();
        vm.expectRevert("Diamond: Function does not exist");
        IMockFacet(address(diamondCutFacet)).functionB();
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update the validation in LibDiamondCut to allow the removal of functions associated with a specific faucet address:
```diff
- require(_facetAddress == address(0),"LibDiamondCut: Remove facet address must be address(0)");
+ require(_facetAddress != address(0),"LibDiamondCut: Remove facet address should not be address(0)");
```
