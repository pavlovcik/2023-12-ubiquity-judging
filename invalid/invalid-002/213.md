# Calling redeem before claiming previous redeem tokens delay previous redeem batches too.

## Summary
Dollars can be collected after a delay on redemption but calling redemption delays all previous redeems too. 
## Vulnerability Detail
Consider Alice has 1000 dollars to redeem and alice calls the `redeemDollar` function and redeem 500 dollar and let's say delay is of 1000 blocks.

But after the 1000 blocks have been added to chain, before calling `collectRedemption()`, alice decides to first call `redeemDollar` and redeem other 500 too. 

The invariant that should hold is : ALice should be able to collect previous 500 Dai, that she is entitled to after redeeming 500 Dai (not considering fee here) as the 1000 blocks has been passed.

But according to implementation his previous payment have been delayed too, due to following line in `redeemDollar()`, when alice called that functions, it sets the variable to current block.number:

```solidity
      poolStorage.lastRedeemedBlock[msg.sender] = block.number;
```

And following function fails in `collectRedemption()`

```solidity
        require(
            (
                poolStorage.lastRedeemedBlock[msg.sender].add(
                    poolStorage.redemptionDelayBlocks
                )
            ) <= block.number,
            "Too soon to collect redemption"
        );
 ```
 
 
## Impact
Redemption can be delayes.

## Tool used
Cats
## Recommendation
Change the code in a way where each redemption is tracked separately.
