# Collect redemption doesn't check if the collateral is enabled

## Summary

A missing check would allow users to call `collectRedemption()` for disabled collaterals.

## Vulnerability Detail

Unlike `mintDollar()` and `redeemDollar()`, the implementation of `collectRedemption()` lacks the `collateralEnabled(collateralIndex)` modifier, that actually checks that the collateral given by `collateralIndex` is enabled.

The implementation does check if redemptions are paused (`isRedeemPaused`) but fails to check if the collateral is enabled `isCollateralEnabled`. The enable/disable configuration should supersede any mint/redeem pause setting. For example, governance may shutdown the collateral in an emergency situation by calling `toggleCollateral()` without actually disabling the individual pause configurations, with the intention of completely halting the collateral.

## Impact

The `collectRedemption()` function fails to check if the , and would still allow to withdraw tokens even if the collateral is disabled.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add the `collateralEnabled` modifier to `collectRedemption()`.

```diff
    function collectRedemption(
        uint256 collateralIndex
-   ) internal returns (uint256 collateralAmount) {
+   ) internal collateralEnabled(collateralIndex) returns (uint256 collateralAmount) {
