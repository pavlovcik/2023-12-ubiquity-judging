# Attacker can manually transfer collateral amount bigger than `poolCeiling` and prevent any new minting

## Summary

`freeCollateralBalance` will use `balanceOf(address(this))` to compute the deposited balance and this value can be manipulated by attackers.

## Vulnerability Detail

When minting, there's a check that the `freeCollateralBalance` is smaller than the pool ceiling. `freeCollateralBalance` will use `balanceOf(address(this))` for checking how much collateral the contract holds. Hence an attacker can transfer the collateral token(s) directly to cause any new minting to revert.

## Impact

This can block minting of ubiquity dollar. The attacker could setup a bot that monitors the `PoolCeilingSet` events and transfers amounts needed to reach the ceiling.

Maybe the attacker could do this during a depeg scenario to further increase instability.

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

Store the deposited values in a state variable instead of using `balanceOf(address(this))`.

If direct transfer of tokens is intended to be supported, you can an an onlyAdmin function that accepts transferred funds to the contract and updates the variable.
