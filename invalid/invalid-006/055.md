# `addCollateralToken` set default heartbeat to 1 days, can lead to stale prices

## Summary
The heartbeat in `LibUbiquityPool` is defined as `collateralPriceFeedStalenessThresholds`, it represent how often price should be update for the given collateral. Tokens such as LUSD, DAI has heartbeat of 3600 seconds, whereas the ubiquityPool uses the 1 days as default. 
If there going to be major price flutuation after last `updateChainLinkCollateralPrice()` call, the pool will update new prices after 1 day instead of an hour. Hence, end up using stale price. 
## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`setCollateralChainLinkPriceFeed()` passes stalenessThreshold as a parameter, to update heartbeat for a specific collateral. Use this internal function to update the stalenessThreshold along with priceFeed or passed another threshold parameter to `addCollateralToken`.
