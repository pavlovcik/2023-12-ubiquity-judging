# _newOwner can be equal to current owner.

## Summary
There is no check for whether the _newOwner is the same as the current owner. While not a security flaw per se, it's redundant to allow ownership transfer to the current owner and could result in unnecessary gas costs.

## Vulnerability Detail
contract OwnershipFacet is IERC173 {
    /// @inheritdoc IERC173
    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) external override {
        require(
            (_newOwner != address(0)),
            "OwnershipFacet: New owner cannot be the zero address"
        );
        LibDiamond.enforceIsContractOwner();
        LibDiamond.setContractOwner(_newOwner);
    }
## Impact
 it's redundant to allow ownership transfer to the current owner and could result in unnecessary gas costs.

## Recommendation
