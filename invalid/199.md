# new  admin role can be same as old admin

## Summary
there is no check whether old admin and new admin are equal or not.
## Vulnerability Detail
   function setRoleAdmin(bytes32 role, bytes32 adminRole) internal {
        bytes32 previousAdminRole = getRoleAdmin(role);
        accessControlStorage().roles[role].adminRole = adminRole;
        emit RoleAdminChanged(role, previousAdminRole, adminRole);
    }
## Impact
it will cause too much gas use.
