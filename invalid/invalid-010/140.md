# The same (incorrect) `heartbeat` is used for multiple price feeds.

## Summary
The same (incorrect) `heartbeat` is used for multiple price feeds.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `collateralPriceFeedStalenessThresholds` is set to 24 hours for every collateral by default.

```solidity
poolStorage.collateralPriceFeedStalenessThresholds.push(1 days);
```

The problem is that different pairs have different `heartbeats`. For example, the `LUSD/USD` price should be stale after not being updated for `3600s`, but since the heartbeat is set to `24 hours` it will consider a price valid even if it wasn't updated for up to 24 hours which is incorrect.

```solidity
require(
    block.timestamp - updatedAt <
        poolStorage.collateralPriceFeedStalenessThresholds[
            collateralIndex
        ],
    "Stale data"
);
```
## Impact
Using the same heartbeat for all price feeds is not correct because the freshness validation would be useless for some pairs which can return stale data.

## Recommendation
Use the `heartbeat` values from the official `chainlink docs` for each price feed separately
