# 24 hours should not be set as PriceFeedStalenessThresholds

## Summary
24 hours should not be set as PriceFeedStalenessThresholds

## Vulnerability Detail
The LibUbiquityPool contract currently sets the heartbeat to 1 day which is equivalent to 24 hours. 

See LibUbiquityPool.sol#L679

```soldiity
poolStorage.collateralPriceFeedStalenessThresholds.push(1 days);
```

Although the admin could reset all the values, See LibUbiquityPool.sol#L717-L719

```solidity
poolStorage.collateralPriceFeedStalenessThresholds[
            collateralIndex
        ] = stalenessThreshold;
```

 there could be a possibility admin won't. Or 1 day would be implemented before admin changes the values
 
(Note: This is similar to one of the rewarded past issues:  See issue 256 of 2022-11-isomorph-judging)

## Impact
There is a risk of stale pricing

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove 24 hours setting for priceFeedStalenessThresholds.
Should allow different priceFeedStalenessThresholds set for different price feed at the beginning
