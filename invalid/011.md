# Quotes from Curve may be subject to manipulation due to `get_virtual_price` read-only reentrancy

## Summary
The `get_dy` makes a call to the `_current_rates()` function, which uses `get_virtual_price()` function. It's known to have a reentrancy risk, which can affect the price if the protocol fetches quotes from pools.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `update` function in the `LibTwapOracle` contract protocol calls the function `get_dy` to obtain a quote from Curve which holds a read-only reentrancy risk. See [here](https://chainsecurity.com/heartbreaks-curve-lp-oracles/) for more info.
## Impact
The read-only reentrancy operation manipulates the updated prices and as a result, the amount minted and redeemed by a user.

## Tool used
Manual Code Review

## Recommendation
The simplest way to detect the Curve's read-only reentrancy is by calling a reentrancy protected function on the Curve pool, e.g. remove_liquidity() with zero amounts. This will revert if the Curve pool is locked and succeed when not locked without actually altering state in the Curve pool.
