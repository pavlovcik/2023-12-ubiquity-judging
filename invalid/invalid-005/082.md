# If Chainlink's aggregator reaches the min price, there is a risk of incorrect asset pricing of collateral

## Summary
Chainlink's aggregators have a built-in circuit breaker in case asset's price drops down below the predetermined range. If it does, the minAnswer will be returned instead of the real price. Current implementation of `_updateChainlinkCollateralPrice` in `LibUbiquityPool.sol` lacks the necessary checks against minAnswer for returned answer.
## Vulnerability Detail
Consider a scenario where LUSD price plummets down below the minAnswer. Since `_updateChainlinkCollateralPrice` function does not have safety checks for minAnswer, it will return the overvalued price of the LUSD. Now, this could be a problem since `mintDollar()` function utilizes curve's TWAP from uDT/3CRV metapool to check if the price is more than the `mintPriceThreshold`and Chainlink's aggregator pricefeed for LUSD and DAI (chosen by user) to calculate the collateral needed. When the LUSD price depegs and the pricefeed returns the overvalued price, the TWAP could still surpass the `mintPriceThreshold`, and the mint continues to calculate the `collateralNeeded` with overvalued price of the LUSD, meaning that one could get the dollar token at a discount, which he can later trade for 3CRV or redeem for DAI token.
## Impact
Loss of funds
