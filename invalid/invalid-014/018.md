# UbiquityPoolFacet::mintDollar Rounding down collateral needed for mint causes a loss of funds for the protocol

## Summary
The formula used to evaluate the collateral needed when minting rounds down the amount. This means that all users mint uAD for slightly cheaper than they should be able to, devaluating uAD. 

## Vulnerability Detail
We can see in `LibUbiquityPool::mint`, collateral amount to pull is evaluated from `dollarAmount` requested by the user:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol#L355

But as we can see this amount of collateral requested is rounded down in `getDollarInCollateral`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol#L284-L294

This means that user receives more in uAD than should be, slightly devaluating uAD.

In the cases of some collaterals such as WBTC which have low decimals: `8`, and high dollar price, the amount of collateral needed can be rounded down to zero. This means a user can effectively mint uAD for free, if such collaterals are accepted in the future

## Impact
The protocol receives less funds due to rounding down when evaluating collateral to pull from user when minting
