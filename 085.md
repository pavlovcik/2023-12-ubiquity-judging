# Possible mev attack

## Summary
Protocols employing on-chain Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) pricing mechanisms on proof-of-stake blockchains are susceptible to Multi-Block Miner Extractable Value (MEV) attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability stems from the potential exploitation of on-chain TWAP pricing mechanisms by malicious actors engaging in multi-block MEV attacks. In these attacks, adversaries manipulate prices across consecutive blocks, creating a risk of inaccurate TWAP values and compromising the integrity of the pricing mechanism.

## Impact
The vulnerability introduces the risk of malicious manipulation of prices over multiple blocks, undermining the reliability of TWAP-based pricing mechanisms. This can lead to distorted market information, impacting the fairness and effectiveness of the protocol relying on on-chain TWAP.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate the risk of Multi-Block MEV attacks, it is recommended to implement robust security measures within the TWAP pricing mechanism. This may involve incorporating additional validation checks, consensus mechanisms, or encryption protocols to enhance the resilience of the on-chain pricing system. Regular security audits and monitoring should be conducted to detect and prevent potential vulnerabilities associated with MEV attacks, ensuring the overall integrity of the protocol.
