# No ability to withdraw fees from LibUbiquityPool

## Summary
Currently there is no ability to withdraw fees from LibUbiquityPool as such functionality is not created.
## Vulnerability Detail
User that mint or redeem UbiquityDollar [pays fee for each action](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol#L358-L364). This fee in form of collateral token is supposed to be used by protocol.

Currently there are several problems with this functionality:
- protocol doesn't have any functionality that allows to withdraw accrued fees.
- library doesn't track exact amount of accrued fee as they come in form of different assets(depends on what user uses as collateral for the mint/redeem)
- `amoMinter` can borrow protocol fees.
## Impact
No ability to track and withdraw fees.
