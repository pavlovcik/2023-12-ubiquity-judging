# Incorrect implementation and usage of TWAP oracle affects Ubiquity Dollar price validation

## Summary
In LibUbiquityPool contract, it validates current Ubiquity Dollar price before minting and redemption, and the Ubiquity Dollar price is determined using TWAP oracle of Curve's metapool.
However, the balance of tokens in Curve's metapool can be much different because Curve supports minting LP only by providing one-sided tokens of the pool, thus resulting in incorrect token price.

## Vulnerability Detail
Curve's cumulative balances are updated before any liquidity changes happen to the pool, e.g. add/remove liquidity, swap, etc.
Since one-side token can be added/removed as liquidity, it is not guaranteed that amounts of tokens are balanced inside the pool. For example, LP token amount of the metapool can be 10x bigger than the amount of Ubiquity Dollar token.
Calculating token price using `get_dy` function based on these balances lead to huge difference in price based on the token balances.

Here's some examples of the price deviation using the [old pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0x20955CB69Ae1515962177D164dfC9522feef567E) deployed by Ubiquity DAO:

1. When token amounts are 3x different, token price looks like $1.129

2. When token amounts are 10x different, token price looks like $2.02

As shown in the images above, Dollar token price can be much different when it's calculated by TWAP balances.

## Impact
Based on how attack is applied, minting/redemption can be disabled or the validation can be ignored to mint/redeem Ubiquity Dollar anytime.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Rather than calculating the average price using TWAP balances, spot price has to be accumulated to calculate time-weighted average price.
