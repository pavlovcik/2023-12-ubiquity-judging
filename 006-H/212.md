# Ubiquity Pool: TWAP price oracle manipulation to steal collateral tokens

## Summary
- The attacker can take advantage of collateral price fluctuation to redeem more collateral at will.
- `LibUbiquityPool`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol#L284
## Vulnerability Detail
- According to the conversation with the devs:
    - The new curve pool liquidity will be `50k uAD + 50k 3CRV`
    - The minting and redeeming fees will be set to `0` for some duration after launch.
- Pre-conditions:
    - uAD Price increases to `$1.01`
    - LUSD price is `$1.03`
    - Mints are open and the ubiquity pool already has some collateral due to previous mints by other users.
- Attack:
    - Alice mints `100,000 uAD` from ubiquity pool's mintDollar function in exchange for `~97,000 LUSD`
    - After some time, the uAD price restabilizes back to `$1`
    - Alice waits for LUSD to drop to `$0.99`
    - As soon as the LUSD price approaches `$0.99`, Alice swaps the uAD-3CRV pool to decrease the price of uAD
    - Alice waits ~10 minutes for TWAP to catch up to `$0.99` for uAD
    - Alice then makes a reverse swap to get back her uAD from the 3CRV pool
    - Now that the uAD price is below `$0.99`, redeems are open
    - So, Alice instantly takes her `~100k uAD` and redeems it for` ~101k` LUSD
    - **Total Spent**: `97,000 LUSD` (for minting uAD) + `~$50` (Slippage for swapping twice [uAD to 3CRV then 3CRV to uAD]) 
    - **Total Received**:` 101,000 LUSD`
    - **Profit**: `~3,800 LUSD`
- The main point that separates this attack from a normal arbitrage is that the attacker can manipulate the curve TWAP price oracle to reduce the price and activate redeems for their benefit.

## Impact
- The profit percentage depends upon the percent decrease in the value of collateral (in this case, LUSD)
- LUSD is more volatile than DAI

- Here's the lowest and highest LUSD price within the last 30 days. It's 6%!

- As the minting and redeeming fees increase, it will require more amount of uAD to extract profit.

- Formula that calculates collateralAmount from the uAD amount and collateral price:
```solidity
uint collateralAmount = dollarAmount
                        .mul(UBIQUITY_POOL_PRICE_PRECISION)
                        .div(10 ** poolStorage.missingDecimals[collateralIndex])
                        .div(poolStorage.collateralPrices[collateralIndex]);
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
- The recommendation is to deploy the curve pool with more liquidity to increase the cost of attack.
- Plus, there should be some fees for minting and redeeming after deployment to decrease attacker profit.
