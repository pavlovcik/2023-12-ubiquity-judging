# LibTWAPOracle price can be manipualted through falsh loans

## Summary

The LibTWAPOracle bases the TWAP price for Ubiquity dollar on a curve meta pool for 3CRV / Ubiquity dollar. [The currently deployed version of that pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0x20955CB69Ae1515962177D164dfC9522feef567E#readContract) uses current pool balance to compute the TWAP price which can easily be manipulated though flash loans. 

Anyone can manipulate the price of Ubiquity dollar reflected by that pool. This will allow for minting/redeeming Ubiquity dollar on `LibUbiquityPool.sol` when normally not possible.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function to update the price of Ubiquity dollar and 3CRV calls `pool.get_dy()` with the twap balances.

```solidity
        uint256[2] memory twapBalances = IMetaPool(ts.pool)
            .get_twap_balances(
                ts.priceCumulativeLast,
                priceCumulative,
                blockTimestamp - ts.pricesBlockTimestampLast
            );

        // price to exchange amountIn Ubiquity Dollar to 3CRV based on TWAP
        ts.price0Average = IMetaPool(ts.pool).get_dy(
            0,
            1,
            1 ether,
            twapBalances
        );
```

`get_dy()` gets the amount of CRV out for 1 ether of Ubiquity dollar in. `get_twap_balances()` gets the average balance across two cumulative prices:

```python
def get_twap_balances(_first_balances: uint256[N_COINS], _last_balances: uint256[N_COINS], _time_elapsed: uint256) -> uint256[N_COINS]:
    balances: uint256[N_COINS] = empty(uint256[N_COINS])
    for x in range(N_COINS):
        balances[x] = (_last_balances[x] - _first_balances[x]) / _time_elapsed
    return balances
```

The cumulative prices are fetched by `LibTWAPOracle` via `currentCumulativePrices()`:

```solidity
    function currentCumulativePrices()
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256[2] memory priceCumulative, uint256 blockTimestamp)
    {
        address metapool = twapOracleStorage().pool;
        priceCumulative = IMetaPool(metapool).get_price_cumulative_last();
        blockTimestamp = IMetaPool(metapool).block_timestamp_last();
    }
```

This calls on the metapool:

```python
def get_price_cumulative_last() -> uint256[N_COINS]:
    return self.price_cumulative_last
```

The value of `price_cumulative_last` is updated in:

```python
@internal
def _update():
    """
    Commits pre-change balances for the previous block
    Can be used to compare against current values for flash loan checks
    """
    elapsed_time: uint256 = block.timestamp - self.block_timestamp_last
    if elapsed_time > 0:
        for i in range(N_COINS):
            _balance: uint256 = self.balances[i]
            self.price_cumulative_last[i] += _balance * elapsed_time
            self.previous_balances[i] = _balance
        self.block_timestamp_last = block.timestamp
```

This purely takes into account the current balance in token of the contract multiplied by the elapsed time. This balance can easily be manipulated by depositing / withdrawing from the metapool.

TheÂ `_update()` function is called at the beginning of any pool function that impacts its balance.

## Impact

An attacker can flash loans and exchange to get 3CRV tokens, deposit a large amount of 3CRV tokens into the metapool, and trigger an update of the cumulative prices via any pool action. This will increase the perceived price of Ubiquity tokens.

This will allow minting Ubiquity tokens in `LibUbiquityPool.sol` when the minting should have been impossible with fair Ubiquity dollar price.

The opposite behaviour where the perceived price of Ubiquity tokens is decreased is also possible if Ubiquity dollars can somehow be flash loaned / exchanged in flash loans or if the attacker holds LP tokens in the meta pool.

This will bring more instability to the Ubiquity dollar as the mechanism supposed to stabilize the coin can be abused.

## Recommendation

In `LibTWAPOracle` only use cumulative prices of previous blocks instead of also relying on the current block.
