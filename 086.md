# UbiquityPool susceptible to flash Loan attacks

## Summary
The `UbiquityPool` is susceptible to flash loan attacks, allowing attackers to manipulate prices and exploit the system. By calling `MintDollar` with one address and subsequently using a flash loan to call `LibUbiquityPool::redeemDollar` with another address, attackers can potentially redeem dollars at an increased price within the same block, leading to an exploitable scenario.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises when an attacker calls `MintDollar` with address A and utilizes a flash loan to invoke `MintDollar` and `LibUbiquityPool::redeemDollar` in line 337 with address B. Although the ideal scenario would prevent the attacker from collecting redemptions in the same block `redeemDollar` is called, the manipulation of prices caused by the flash loan creates an opportunity for the attacker to redeem dollars at an elevated price with `AddressA`.

## Impact
This susceptibility opens the door to exploitative actions by attackers, potentially resulting in financial losses and disrupting the intended functionality of the `UbiquityPool`. The flash loan manipulation can lead to a distorted price environment, allowing the attacker to redeem dollars at a higher value before the flash loan reverts.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Introducing a time lock or cooldown period after a flash loan or any significant transaction can add an additional layer of security.
