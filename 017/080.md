# user/MEV can frontrun and backrun the oracle update of an collateral price against USD and steal funds from the protocol(Possible arbitrage from Chainlink price discrepancy )

## Summary
The problem is that a user can know which direction the oracle price of a collateral against USD will move, before it does, either through watching the collateral price against USD move in advance of the oracle updating, or watching the mempool for oracle update transactions and frontrunning them.


## Vulnerability Detail
Letâ€™s take example , let assume
1e18 collateral price = 1e18 USD,  now the exchange rate of the asset will be updated to 1e18 collateral price = 0.95e18 USD.assume that minting fee and redemption fee is 0.
user/MEV can frontrun and let assume users call the function mintdollar with 100  maxCollateralIn amount and mint 100 dollar (as oracle price is still not updated yet) . After the oracle price is updated, the user can backrun(withdraw/redeem his 100 dollar) because 100 dollar is now worth 105 collateral tokens. So user/mev make a profit of 5 collateral tokens.

This can also happen in opposite direction,let assume
1 collateral price = 1 USD,  now the exchange rate of the asset will be updated to 1 collateral price = 1.05 USD.
user/MEV(previously deposited) can frontrun and redeem  100 dollar (as oracle price is still not updated yet).After the oracle price is updated, the user can backrun and deposit 100 collateral tokens, and get 105 dollar .

## Impact
Attackers can gain profit and steal collateral .

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
implementing a 1 hour waiting period on mintdollar/ redeemdollar or
storing minting and redemptions and executing them at a future exchange rate or creating pause/unpause for minting/redeeming .
