# Precision loss while downscaling Chainlink price feed

## Summary

Chainlink price responses are downscaled to 6 decimals, causing a potential loss of value due to the precision reduction of prices used in intermediary calculations.

## Vulnerability Detail

Prices coming from the Chainlink oracle are always downscaled and stored in 6 decimals precision: 

```solidity
        // convert chainlink price to 6 decimals
        uint256 price = uint256(answer).mul(UBIQUITY_POOL_PRICE_PRECISION).div(
            10 ** priceFeedDecimals
        );
```

This allows a normalization of collateral prices in the domain of 6 decimals, but causes a premature loss of precision as prices will be stored with the reduced precision before they are effectively used.

The loss of precision will be in the order of `priceFeedDecimals - 6`, so when `priceFeedDecimals > 6` the effective loss of precision in the price representation will be `10 ** (priceFeedDecimals - 6) - 1`. Note that these represent scalar values, prices are expected to be later projected into net amounts in calculations such as `collateralUsdBalance()` or `getDollarInCollateral()`.

## Impact

Premature downscaling of oracle prices will cause a loss of precision of up to `10 ** (priceFeedDecimals - 6) - 1` that will be carried forward to `getDollarInCollateral()`, a key function that is used to convert between dollars and collateral while minting and redeeming.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Store the prices in full precision, along with the feed decimals. Normalize decimals when these are later used in `getDollarInCollateral()`.
