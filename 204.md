# UbiquityPool implementation doesn't support tokens with more than 18 decimals

## Summary

The implementation of UbiquityPool will revert when a collateral token with more than 18 decimals is configured in the system.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a new collateral is added to the pool, the contract will store the difference of 18 and the collateral token decimals in the `missingDecimals` array. 

```solidity
poolStorage.missingDecimals.push(
    uint256(18).sub(ERC20(collateralAddress).decimals())
);
```

However, this will cause an underflow if the collateral token decimals are greater than 18 due to the checked unsigned integer math. Any decimal value greater than 18 will cause a revert in the `addCollateralToken()` function.

## Impact

The protocol cannot support collateral tokens with decimals greater than 18.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Instead of storing the difference of `18 - decimals` in `missingDecimals`, store just the decimals and then normalize based on which value is greater. If the token's decimals are greater than 18, then normalize by dividing by `decimals - 18`, else multiply by `18 - decimals`.
