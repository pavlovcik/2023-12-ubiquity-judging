# Protocol incorrectly calculates how much collateral is needed for minting Dollar tokens

## Summary
Protocol falsely assumes that 1 Dollar is always 1 USD when calculating needed collateral amount during when minting new Dollar tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
Inside [LibUbiquityPool.sol:getDollarInCollateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol#L284) doesn't take into consideration the price of the Dollar token in USD but only its amount. Essentially the calculations says:

```javascript
  function test_collateralCalc() public {
        uint256 dollarAmount = 2e18; // 2 Dollar
        uint256 UBIQUITY_POOL_PRICE_PRECISION = 1e6;
        uint256 LUSD_missingDecimals = 0;
        uint256 LUSD_pricePerOneTokenInUSD = 1e6; // 1 USD

        uint256 neededCollateral = dollarAmount * UBIQUITY_POOL_PRICE_PRECISION / 10 ** LUSD_missingDecimals / LUSD_pricePerOneTokenInUSD;

        assertEq(neededCollateral, 2e18);
    }
```

## Impact
If the Dollar token costs 0.9 USD users will pay 1 USD in collateral value per token. Additionally in the mintDollar function there is a fee that decreases the dollar amount that is minted to the user further, essentially overcharging the user.  Undercharging also happens when 1 Dollar is 1.1 USD in value, then for each Dollar token protocol will get only 1 USD of collateral value (without taking fees into consideration here).

## Recommendation
Instead of dollar amount * UBIQUITY_POOL_PRICE_PRECISION use dollarAmount * dollarPricePerTokenInUSD in the calculation.
