# TWAP oracle is manipulable as the only time-window requirement is `blockTimestamp - ts.pricesBlockTimestampLast > 0`

## Summary
TWAP oracle is more manipulable because its time-window can be as short as one block time.

## Vulnerability Detail
TWAP oracle are used to make it exponentially expensive to manipulate the price. 
This is done by not getting the spot price of a pool, but rather the time weighted averaged price over a period of time.
The longer the period, the harder it is to manipulate the price (but the laggier is the price representation)

The `update` function in `LibTWAPOracle` can be called once every block as the only requirement is the time difference between to consecutive calls is >0.
Not only it is called everytime `mintDollar` or `redeemDollar` is called (reducing the time-window to the time between two calls of these function), as it is also a [public function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/facets/TWAPOracleDollar3poolFacet.sol#L32-L34) in the `TWAPOracleDollar3poolFacet`, so anyone can control the time-window.
This means the price is calculated between block N and block N-1, which really reduce the impact and goal of a TWAP here.

## Impact
The TWAP advantage is not used correctly, increasing the feasibility of an attack based on Dollar price manipulation.
The `LibUbiqityPool.getDollarPriceUsd()` make use of these prices [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol#L347) and [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol#L419), which is used as a protection mechanism for the Dollar peg.
We can also easily imagine in the future that this TWAP oracle can be used for other functions, which will then be vulnerable to a price manipulation.

```solidity

71:         (

73:             uint256 blockTimestamp
74:         ) = currentCumulativePrices();
75: @>      if (blockTimestamp - ts.pricesBlockTimestampLast > 0) {	
76:             // get the balances between now and the last price cumulative snapshot
77:             uint256[2] memory twapBalances = IMetaPool(ts.pool)			
78:                 .get_twap_balances(				
79:                     ts.priceCumulativeLast,
80:                     priceCumulative,
81: @>                  blockTimestamp - ts.pricesBlockTimestampLast	
82:                 );

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a configurable time period, and either update the TWAP price once very period, or use a sliding window.
