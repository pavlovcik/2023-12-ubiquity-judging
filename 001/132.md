# amoMinterBorrow should check the available pool balance before borrowing

amoMinterBorrow should check the available pool balance before borrowing

## Summary

`amoMinterBorrow` can borrow all the balance for a token including values that were claimed and not yet redeemed by users.

## Vulnerability Detail

Assuming a user deposits 10k LUSD in the pool some time later he burn his ubiquity dollar in exchange for the LUSD back (calls `redeemDollar`). Before he calls `collectRedemption`, `amoMinterBorrow` gets called and pulls all available LUSD tokens out of the contracts preventing the user from withdrawing.

Malicious admin is not a valid finding for sherlock contests, but perhaps this could happen accidentally. Meaning, amo bots may take user funds without intention. Ideally, they should only be able to borrow values that are not unclaimed.

## Impact

Users won't be able to withdraw and lose trust in ubiquity.

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

Check that `collateralAmount` is smaller than the total deposited funds minus `unclaimedPoolBalance` when calling `amoMinterBorrow`.
