# AMO minter may borrow more funds than pool free balance unintentionally and make pool insolvent

## Summary
AMO minter may borrow more funds than pool free balance unintentionally and make pool insolvent.

## Vulnerability Detail
When AMO minter borrows from Ubiquity pool, funds will be transferred out without checking if pool free balance is larger than the borrowed amount.

It is possible that a user redeems at the same time, and if the AMO minter's transaction is executed after the user's, more funds than free balance may be transferred out and the pool becomes insolvent.

Imagine the following scenario:
1. Pool free balance is 50K;
2. An AMO minter submits a transaction to borrow 20K;
3. At the same time, a user submits a transaction to redeem 40K;
4. User's transaction is executed first, pool free balance becomes 10K;
5. AMO minter's transaction gets executed, 20K is transferred out from the pool;
6. When user collects redemption, transaction will fail because there is only 30K left in the pool;

## Impact
Pool becomes insolvent.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When AMO minter borrows from pool, protocol should check if the pool free balance is sufficient.
