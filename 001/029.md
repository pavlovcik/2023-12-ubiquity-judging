# Users can still redeem their assets even after the collateral has been disabled.

## Summary

The `collectRedemption` function, responsible for collecting collateral tokens after redeeming Ubiquity Dollars, currently lacks a check to verify whether the collateral has been disabled. This omission could allow users to redeem disabled collateral from the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

Redeem process is split in two steps:
1. `redeemDollar()` will burn users' Ubiquity Dollar and record the amounts of collateral users could receive.

```solidity
    function redeemDollar(
        uint256 collateralIndex,
        uint256 dollarAmount,
        uint256 collateralOutMin
    )
        internal
        //@audit users can not redeem disabled collateral
        collateralEnabled(collateralIndex)
        returns (uint256 collateralOut)
    {
```

2. `collectRedemption()` send the collateral to the users.
```solidity
    function collectRedemption(
        uint256 collateralIndex
//@audit If the collateral is disabled after redeemDollar, users could still receive the collateral
    ) internal returns (uint256 collateralAmount) {
```

However, only the first function, `redeemDollar`, checks if the collateral is enabled. This means that if a collateral is disabled after `redeemDollar`, users could still obtain the collateral through the `collectRedemption` function.

## Impact

Users might have the ability to redeem disabled collateral from the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It's recommended to add a check in the function `collectRedemption`.
