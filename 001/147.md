# AmoMinter is able to borrow unclaimed user collateral

## Summary
AmoMinter is able to borrow unclaimed user funds which would leave some users not being able to withdraw their funds after burning their Dollar token.

## Vulnerability Detail
Inside [LibUbiquityPool.sol:amoMinterBorrow](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol#L574) the amoMinter is able to borrow all the contract collateral without keeping in mind that users that have already burned their Dollar tokens could be about to collect their redemption.

```javascript
IERC20(poolStorage.collateralAddresses[minterCollateralIndex])
            .safeTransfer(msg.sender, collateralAmount);
```
