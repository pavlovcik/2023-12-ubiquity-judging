# AMO minters borrowing `> unclaimedCollateral` may leave collectors empty handed

## Summary
AMO minters borrow collateral from ubiquity pool to make yield in external protocol. However, while it borrows, the contract has missing check whether there is enough collateral balance to fulfilled `unclaimedCollateralBalance`. 
## Vulnerability Detail
User can `redeemDollar` for their deposited collateral, which increases  
```solidity
        poolStorage.redeemCollateralBalances[msg.sender][collateralIndex] = 
            poolStorage.redeemCollateralBalances[msg.sender][collateralIndex].add(collateralOut);
        
        poolStorage.unclaimedPoolCollateral[collateralIndex] = 
            poolStorage.unclaimedPoolCollateral[collateralIndex].add(collateralOut);
```
Note that we also ensure that there should be enough collateral to be claimed by the user, with following check
```solidity 
        require(
            collateralOut <=
                (IERC20(poolStorage.collateralAddresses[collateralIndex]))
                    .balanceOf(address(this))
                    .sub(poolStorage.unclaimedPoolCollateral[collateralIndex]),
            "Insufficient pool collateral"
        );
``` 

With the above two snippet, we can conclude that the `unclaimedPoolCollateral` is always backed by at least the same amount of collateral tokens. 

However, there is no cap on borrowing amount of collateral tokens for AMO minters,

```solidity
    function amoMinterBorrow(uint256 collateralAmount) internal onlyAmoMinter {  // I want collateralAmount
	...SNIP...

        // transfer
        IERC20(poolStorage.collateralAddresses[minterCollateralIndex])
            .safeTransfer(msg.sender, collateralAmount); // hold my collateralAmount
    }
``` 
, leading to emptying the pool balance below `unclaimedPoolCollateral` value. 

## Impact
Users failed to call `collectRedemption`, even though `redeemDollar` before did verified that there is enough collateral.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add below check, which only allows borrowing when there is enough freed collateral balance.  
```solidity
    function amoMinterBorrow(uint256 collateralAmount) internal onlyAmoMinter {
        ...SNIP...
        require(freeCollateralBalance(minterCollateralIndex) >= collateralAmount, "not enough funds"); 
        // transfer
        IERC20(poolStorage.collateralAddresses[minterCollateralIndex])
            .safeTransfer(msg.sender, collateralAmount);
    }
```
