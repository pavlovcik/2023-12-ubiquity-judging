# amoMinterBorrow can borrow unclaimedPoolCollateral

## Summary
amoMinterBorrow can borrow unclaimedPoolCollateral that belongs to redeemers.
## Vulnerability Detail
When user redeem ubiquity dollar, then funds are not sent to the user in same block, [they are locked instead for some amount of blocks](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol#L448-L458). So after those few blocks user is able to [claim his funds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol#L514-L515).

The funds, that are marked for redeemers is not considered [to be on contract balance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol#L275), so they can't be used anyhow.

But `amoMinterBorrow` function doesn't check that `collateralAmount` is smaller than `freeCollateralBalance` and thus it allows [to borrow more](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol#L596-L597), which will take funds that are reserved for the redeemers.
## Impact
Redeemers will not be able to get their funds.
