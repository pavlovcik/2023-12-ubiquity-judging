# Underflow in `freeCollateralBalance()` may possibly DoS the AMO minters contract,

## Summary
**File: IUbiquityPool.sol** 
```solidity
/**
 * @notice Returns free collateral balance (i.e. that can be borrowed by AMO minters)
 * @param collateralIndex collateral token index
 * @return Amount of free collateral
 */
function freeCollateralBalance(
    uint256 collateralIndex
) external view returns (uint256);
```
It is mentioned in comment above that the `freeCollateralBalance` return the available collateral balance that can be borrowed by AMO minters. However, if the call encounters an underflow, it can potentially cause an issue with external protocol that utilize this value to borrow collateral out of ubiquity pool. 
 
ok, so how it is possible that it'll underflow? there can be possibly more than one AMO minters for a collateral, and also there is no cap on their borrow amount. If even either one of them borrows collateral such that the current balance of collateral exceed unclaimedPoolCollateral, it'll results in underflow.  
## Vulnerability Detail
See above. 
## Impact
External AMO minters(smart contract) requiring `freeCollateralBalance`  to be `>0` will failed to borrow, bc of underrflow. Also the ubiquity pool `collateralUsdBalance()` using it internally, which will be DoS.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify `freeCollateralBalance` to below; 
```solidity
function freeCollateralBalance(
    uint256 collateralIndex
) internal view returns (uint256) {
    UbiquityPoolStorage storage poolStorage = ubiquityPoolStorage();
    if(IERC20(poolStorage.collateralAddresses[collateralIndex]).balanceOf(address(this)) 
            <= poolStorage.unclaimedPoolCollateral[collateralIndex]) return 0; 
    return
        IERC20(poolStorage.collateralAddresses[collateralIndex])
            .balanceOf(address(this))
            .sub(poolStorage.unclaimedPoolCollateral[collateralIndex]);
}
```
