# Minting and redemption requests DOS due to underflow when an AMO Minter borrows

## Summary
Minting and making new redemption requests will be DOS'd for an unpredictable time period.
## Vulnerability Detail
When a user is trying to `LibUbiquityPool#mintDollar()` there is the following require statement:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/d9c39e8dfd5601e7e8db2e4b3390e7d8dff42a8e/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol#L370-L375

```javascript
        // check the pool ceiling
        require(
            freeCollateralBalance(collateralIndex).add(collateralNeeded) <=
                poolStorage.poolCeilings[collateralIndex],
            "Pool ceiling"
        );
```

And if we look at `LibUbiquityPool#freeCollateralBalance()` closer:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/d9c39e8dfd5601e7e8db2e4b3390e7d8dff42a8e/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol#L268-L276

```javascript
    function freeCollateralBalance(
        uint256 collateralIndex
    ) internal view returns (uint256) {
        UbiquityPoolStorage storage poolStorage = ubiquityPoolStorage();
        return
            IERC20(poolStorage.collateralAddresses[collateralIndex])
                .balanceOf(address(this))
                .sub(poolStorage.unclaimedPoolCollateral[collateralIndex]);
    }
```

In essence, in order to `mintDollar()`, this must be true: (contract's collateral balance - unclaimed collateral) + collateral needed for mint <= pool ceiling.

There is a state which can be reached where there is enough pool ceiling for a mint to occur, but in which the `freeCollateralBalance()` function reverts due to underflow, when an AMO minter has borrowed from the contract balance. That is possible since upon borrow the `freeCollateralBalance()` function is not included in any checks *even though the comments above the function point that it's intention is to be used with the AMO borrow.*

>@notice Returns free collateral balance (i.e. that can be borrowed by AMO minters)

So let's look at the following scenario (simplifying example with 1e18 decimal token but decimals don't matter in this case):

- `poolCeiling == 5000e18`
- `collateral.balanceOf(address(this)) == 4000e18`
- `unclaimedPoolCollateral == 3000e18`

1. AMO Minter takes a borrow for `2500e18` collateral tokens, the contract collateral balance is now down to `1500e18`
2. Alice tries to mint `1000e18` new tokens and when `mintDollar()` invokes the `freeCollateralBalance()` check: `balanceOf(address(this)) - unclaimedPoolCollateral` will be `1500e18 - 3000e18`:

```javascript
function freeCollateralBalance(...) {
        ...
            IERC20(poolStorage.collateralAddresses[collateralIndex]) // @audit a state is possible where this underflow reverts e.g. 1500e18 - 3000e18 when AMO has borrowed
                .balanceOf(address(this))
                .sub(poolStorage.unclaimedPoolCollateral[collateralIndex]);
    }
```

3. This will underflow and the whole function will revert - so even though technically the ceiling is not reached and there is space for `1000e18` more collateral, due to the borrow this will not be possible and minting will be DOS'd either until the borrow is returned, or Bob calls `collectRedemption()` which are both unpredictable

If we also take a look at `LibUbiquityPool#redeemDollar()` there is the following check:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/d9c39e8dfd5601e7e8db2e4b3390e7d8dff42a8e/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol#L438-L444

```javascript
        require(
            collateralOut <=
                (IERC20(poolStorage.collateralAddresses[collateralIndex]))
                    .balanceOf(address(this))
                    .sub(poolStorage.unclaimedPoolCollateral[collateralIndex]),
            "Insufficient pool collateral"
        );
```

Thus both minting and making new redemption requests will be DOS'd for an unpredictable time period.

## Impact
Minting and making new redemption requests will be DOS'd for an unpredictable time period.

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
One solution I could think of is to maybe create a variable `availableCollateralForBorrow` which allocates a part of the collateral accessible only for the `AMO Minter` or something similar.
