# UbiquityPool::amoMinterBorrow Borrows by AMOs will DOS user redeems

## Summary
Currently AMO borrowing is untracked by UbiquityPool and a user is simply unable to redeem the collateral borrowed by an AMO.

## Vulnerability Detail
Users are able to redeem the amount computed by `freeCollateralBalance`. However when an AMO borrows from the pool, they reduce the freeCollateralBalance by the amount borrowed. This means that all users are not able to redeem at that moment. There is no mechanism to pull back the funds from the AMO in case liquidity is insufficient, this may cause unecessary panic and a bank run because users will be in fear of not being able to withdraw

## Impact
Some users will be denied withdrawals for an undefinite amount of time (until AMO repays the borrow).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a mechanism which maintains a liquidity ratio to be able to serve withdrawals and pulls funds back from AMOs when liquidity is insufficient.
