# LibUbiquityPool.amoMinterBorrow does not check the amount of collateral to borrow

## Summary

The total amount of collateral in the current contract, that is, `collateralToken.balanceOf(address(this))`, includes two parts: **the amount** that can be borrowed by amoMinter and **the amount** that has been redeemed by the user. However, in [[LibUbiquityPool.amoMinterBorrow](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol#L596-L597)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol#L596-L597), the argument `collateralAmount` passed in by caller is regarded as the amount that can be borrowed. If `collateralAmount` contains the amount that the users have redeemed, it will result in users being unable to collect collateral due to insufficient balance.

## Vulnerability Detail

`UbiquityPoolFacet.amoMinterBorrow` subcalls `LibUbiquityPool.amoMinterBorrow` which [does not check whether the contract has enough `collateralAmount` to borrow, and directly transfers `collateralAmount` collateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol#L574-L597). **This may include the amount users have redeemed**.

Redeem process is split in two steps: `redeemDollar` and `collectRedemption`.

[[redeemDollar](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol#L399-L403)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol#L399-L403) will internally [[accumulate the amount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol#L448-L456)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol#L448-L456) that the user can redeem into `poolStorage.redeemCollateralBalances[msg.sender][collateralIndex]` and `poolStorage.unclaimedPoolCollateral[collateralIndex]`. **This means that the amount is already reserved for this user and cannot be borrowed**.

After passing `redemptionDelayBlocks`, [[collectRedemption](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol#L476-L478)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol#L476-L478) can be called to actually get the collateral recorded in `poolStorage.redeemCollateralBalances[msg.sender][collateralIndex]` and [deduct it from `poolStorage.unclaimedPoolCollateral[collateralIndex]`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol#L506-L508).

Assume the following scenario:

1.  The amount of collateral held by the current contract is `100e18`,
2.  Alice call `redeemDollar`Â  to redeem `30e18`.
3.  An amoMinter borrows all the collateral (100e18) via `amoMinterBorrow`, then `collateral.balanceOf(address(this)) = 0`.
4.  After waiting for `redemptionDelayBlocks`, alice will not be able to successfully call `collectRedemption` to get 30e18 collateral.

## Impact

The amount originally reserved for redemption is borrowed, resulting in users being unable to collect the redeemed collateral in a timely manner. The price of collateral changes over time, which brings risks to users.
