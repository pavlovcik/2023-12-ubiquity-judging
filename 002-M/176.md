# LibTWAPOracle.setPool can be DoS'd by sending 1 wei to imbalance pools reserves

## Summary
It is cheap and easy to DoS/prevent the setting of a pool as an oracle

## Vulnerability Detail
the `setPool` function is used to set a Curve MetaPool as the TWAP oracle reference. 
There's multiple sanity checks performed inside, one of them ensuring that the reserve of both tokens is the same.
It make the call vulnerable to DoS front-running by sending 1 wei of any of both tokens to imbalance the pool and make the call revert.
Also, if you check the different MetaPools, you'll see that reserves aren't balanced.

## Impact
Not allowing to set up the oracle

```solidity
File: src\dollar\libraries\LibTWAPOracle.sol
32:     function setPool(address _pool, address _curve3CRVToken1) internal {
33:         require(
34:             IMetaPool(_pool).coins(0) ==
35:                 LibAppStorage.appStorage().dollarTokenAddress,
36:             "TWAPOracle: FIRST_COIN_NOT_DOLLAR"
37:         );
38:         TWAPOracleStorage storage ts = twapOracleStorage();
39: 
40:         // coin at index 0 is Ubiquity Dollar and index 1 is 3CRV
41:         require(
42:             IMetaPool(_pool).coins(1) == _curve3CRVToken1,
43:             "TWAPOracle: COIN_ORDER_MISMATCH"
44:         );
45: 
46:         uint256 _reserve0 = uint112(IMetaPool(_pool).balances(0));
47:         uint256 _reserve1 = uint112(IMetaPool(_pool).balances(1));
48:
49:         // ensure that there's liquidity in the pair
50:         require(_reserve0 != 0 && _reserve1 != 0, "TWAPOracle: NO_RESERVES");
51:         // ensure that pair balance is perfect
52: @>      require(_reserve0 == _reserve1, "TWAPOracle: PAIR_UNBALANCED"); 
53:         ts.priceCumulativeLast = IMetaPool(_pool).get_price_cumulative_last()
54:         ts.pricesBlockTimestampLast = IMetaPool(_pool).block_timestamp_last();
55:         ts.pool = _pool;
56:         // dollar token is inside the diamond
57:         ts.token1 = _curve3CRVToken1;
58:         ts.price0Average = 1 ether;
59:         ts.price1Average = 1 ether;
60:     }
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
There is no reason to ensure balances are perfect in the pool, as this is only true at the very beginning of the existence of the pool. Any first trade will imbalance the reserves.
