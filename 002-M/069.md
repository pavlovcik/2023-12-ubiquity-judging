# TWAPOracleDollar3poolFacet.setPool can be griefed

## Summary
Attacker can not allow ubiqiuty protocol to call `TWAPOracleDollar3poolFacet.setPool`, because of pool balance check
## Vulnerability Detail
`TWAPOracleDollar3poolFacet.setPool` function allows protocol to set their curve pool that will be used to fetch prices.
The function has [balance check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibTWAPOracle.sol#L51) that wants reserves to be equal.

Such check allows anyone to change reserves in the pool, before `setPool` call in order to make tx fail. Then protocol will need to redeploy library and remove check or create a script that will control balance in the pool to be equal to be able to set the pool.
## Impact
Attacker can not allow to `setPool`.
