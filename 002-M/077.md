# LibTWAPOracle.setPool may not be executed successfully

## Summary

Before the core functions in UbiquityPoolFacet (`mintDollar`/`redeemDollar`/`collectRedemption`) can work properly, `TWAPOracleDollar3poolFacet.setPool` needs to be successfully executed. The logic inside this function has a check to ensure that [[the pair balance is perfect](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibTWAPOracle.sol#L51)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibTWAPOracle.sol#L51), which can be broken by a malicious user by calling `MetaPool.exchange/remove_liquidity/add_liquidity`. As a result, `setPool` will never be called successfully.

## Vulnerability Detail

`TWAPOracleDollar3poolFacet.setPool` sub-calls [[LibTWAPOracle.setPool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibTWAPOracle.sol#L31)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibTWAPOracle.sol#L31).

```solidity
File: ubiquity-dollar\packages\contracts\src\dollar\libraries\LibTWAPOracle.sol
31:     function setPool(address _pool, address _curve3CRVToken1) internal {
......
45:         uint256 _reserve0 = uint112(IMetaPool(_pool).balances(0));
46:         uint256 _reserve1 = uint112(IMetaPool(_pool).balances(1));
47: 
48:         // ensure that there's liquidity in the pair
49:         require(_reserve0 != 0 && _reserve1 != 0, "TWAPOracle: NO_RESERVES");
50:         // ensure that pair balance is perfect
51:->       require(_reserve0 == _reserve1, "TWAPOracle: PAIR_UNBALANCED");
......
59:     }
```

`_pool` has 2 types of tokens: `token0`(dollarToken) and `token1`(curve3CRVToken).

L45, `_reserve0` is equal to the amount of `token0` recorded by `_pool`.

L46, `_reserve1` is equal to the amount of `token1` recorded by `_pool`.

L51, `_reserve0` must equal to `_reserve1`, otherwise, tx will revert.

Therefore, a malicious user could call `_pool.exchange` to break this check by front-running `TWAPOracleDollar3poolFacet.setPool`. Of course, you can also write a program to check whether the status of the pool meets `_reserve0 == _reserve1` to call `_pool.exchange`.

## Impact

pool can't be set, so the core functions of UbiquityPoolFacet are broken.

## Recommendation

Please do not use `==` to ensure that pair balance is perfect.
