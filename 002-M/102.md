# Curve pool may not be set as oracle, because it perfect 1:1 ratio of uAD, which is hardly possible and anyone can break it depositing/swapping 1 wei

## Summary
Protocol sets curve uAD/3CRV metapool as an oracle pool. There is function `LibTWAPOracle::setPool`, which set the pool for ubiquity pool, but there is one validation, which is hardly achievable `require(_reserve0 != 0 && _reserve1 != 0, "TWAPOracle: NO_RESERVES");`
## Vulnerability Detail
Curve metapools are pools between 3pool (DAI, USDC, USDT) and another stablecoin pair. The pool liquidity aims to be balanced between the pair, but it is almost impossible to have exact 1:1 allocation of funds in metapool. Here is an example for quite stable pool `USD Metapool: Liquity`:
```solidity
balances[0] = 1744991529279388548540004
balances[1] = 12642007799752756617751200
```
For each stable metapool that you check, there won't be 1:1 ratio between two assets, which means that following the current implementation, code cannot be deployed. Tests are working, because mocked metapool doesn't really act as a real one.
## Coded PoC:
```diff
// Location `contracts/src/dollar/mocks/MockMetaPool.sol`
function add_liquidity(
        uint256[2] memory _amounts,
        uint256 _min_mint_amount,
        address _receiver
    ) external returns (uint256 result) {
        mint(
            _receiver,
            _min_mint_amount == 0
                ? _amounts[0] > _amounts[1] ? _amounts[0] : _amounts[1]
                : _min_mint_amount
        );
+        balances[0] += _amounts[0];
+        balances[1] += _amounts[1];
        return result;
    }
```

```diff
// Location `contracts/test/diamond/facets/TWAPOracleFacet.t.sol`
function setUp() public override {
        super.setUp();

+        vm.startPrank(admin);
+        dollarToken.mint(address(this), 100);
+        vm.stopPrank();

        metaPoolAddress = address(
            new MockMetaPool(address(dollarToken), curve3CRVTokenAddress)
        );

+        // Front-run transaction, which cost low and stop TWAP pool from being set
+        uint256[2] memory arr = [uint256(1), uint256(0)];
+        MockMetaPool(metaPoolAddress).add_liquidity(arr, 0, address(this));

        vm.prank(owner);
+        vm.expectRevert();
        twapOracleDollar3PoolFacet.setPool(
            metaPoolAddress,
            curve3CRVTokenAddress
        );
    }

+    function testSetUpNotPossibleWhenMaliciousUserDeposit1weiInMetaPool()
+        public
+    {}
```
## Impact
- Impossibility for the protocol to set a metapool. 
- Need of new implementation of `LibTWAPOracle`
- Resources for the protocol

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
- If you want to remain the check implement a tolerance in % , which may be the difference between liquidity of two assets
Example of 5% tolerance:
```solidity
// Ensure that pair balance is within 5% tolerance
   uint256 tolerance = (_reserve0 * 5) / 100;
   require(
       _reserve0 >= _reserve1 - tolerance && _reserve0 <= _reserve1 + tolerance,
       "TWAPOracle: PAIR_UNBALANCED"
   );
```
