# Calldata length is not validated in Diamond dispatch logic

## Summary

The implementation of the Diamond dispatch logic doesn't validate the length of calldata to ensure the presence of a selector, potentially creating a conflict in which an empty or shorter calldata will be interpreted as a dispatch to a function 

## Vulnerability Detail

Since the protocol has removed the `receive()` function from the reference Diamond implementation (see https://github.com/mudgen/diamond-3-hardhat/blob/main/contracts/Diamond.sol#L62), the fallback function will also take calls that have empty calldata.

Under this scenario, `msg.sig` will still be interpreted as `bytes4(0)`, which will try to incorrectly fetch a selector using this key.

Similarly, it is also possible to specify a non-empty but shorter calldata, anything shorter than 4 bytes will be interpreted as a 4 byte value padded with 0. So for example, `0x112233` will be interpreted as a function selector of value `0x11223300`.

## Impact

Calls to the diamond proxy with calldata shorter than 4 bytes will incorrectly fetch a selector using a shorter key, which could cause potential conflicts with valid selectors.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure the length of the calldata is at least 4 bytes long.

```diff
fallback() external payable {
+   require(msg.data.length >= 4, "missing selector");
    ...
}
```
