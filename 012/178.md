# Wrong rouding direction in mintDollar make it possible to mint Dollars against 0 collateral

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The `getDollarInCollateral(uint256 collateralIndex, uint256 dollarAmount)` function round down the value, and is used in both the `mintDollar` and `redeemDollar` functions.

While its a correct implementation in the `redeemDollar`, it is not for the `mintDollar` as it make it possible for a user to mint Dollar tokens against 0 of his collateral due to the rounding down of the `collateralNeeded` result.


```solidity
File: src\dollar\libraries\LibUbiquityPool.sol
284:     function getDollarInCollateral(
285:         uint256 collateralIndex,
286:         uint256 dollarAmount
287:     ) internal view returns (uint256) {
288:         UbiquityPoolStorage storage poolStorage = ubiquityPoolStorage();
289:         return
290:             dollarAmount // if dollarAmount exponent is less than missingDecimal return 0
291:                 .mul(UBIQUITY_POOL_PRICE_PRECISION) //1e6
292:                 .div(10 ** poolStorage.missingDecimals[collateralIndex])
293:                 .div(poolStorage.collateralPrices[collateralIndex]); //1e6 
294:     }
```


This can though only happen with collateral with decimals <18, and these kind of tokens seems expected in the future as there's a parameter [dedicated for that](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol#L56)

## Impact
Leak of value for the pool, that will add up over time.
The last user of the pool will not be able to redeem its whole balance (user could also be a smart-contract always redeeming the exact balance it minted)

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Round up as it is expected for such operations, or ensure that `collateralNeeded > 0` when minting
