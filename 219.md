# Function Selector Clashes:

## Summary
Function Selector Clashes: The code assumes that function selectors are unique and does not handle the case where two different functions could have the same selector due to a hash collision. This is a theoretical risk, as collisions are highly unlikely, but it's something to be aware of.

## Vulnerability Detail
 function addFunctions(
        address _facetAddress,
        bytes4[] memory _functionSelectors
    ) internal {
        require(
            _functionSelectors.length > 0,
            "LibDiamondCut: No selectors in facet to cut"
        );
        DiamondStorage storage ds = diamondStorage();
        require(
            _facetAddress != address(0),
            "LibDiamondCut: Add facet can't be address(0)"
        );
        uint96 selectorPosition = uint96(
            ds.facetFunctionSelectors[_facetAddress].functionSelectors.length
        );
        // add new facet address if it does not exist
        if (selectorPosition == 0) {
            addFacet(ds, _facetAddress);
        }
        for (
            uint256 selectorIndex;
            selectorIndex < _functionSelectors.length;
            selectorIndex++
        ) {
            bytes4 selector = _functionSelectors[selectorIndex];
            address oldFacetAddress = ds
                .selectorToFacetAndPosition[selector]
                .facetAddress;
            require(
                oldFacetAddress == address(0),
                "LibDiamondCut: Can't add function that already exists"
            );
            addFunction(ds, selector, selectorPosition, _facetAddress);
            selectorPosition++;
        }
    }

## Impact
function selectors are unique and does not handle the case where two different functions could have the same selector due to a hash collision. This is a theoretical risk, as collisions are highly unlikely, but it's something to be aware of.
