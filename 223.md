# Assumption of Equal Reserves

## Summary
Assumption of Equal Reserves: The setPool function requires that the reserves for both tokens in the pool are equal. This is a strong assumption and may not always hold true, especially in volatile markets.

## Vulnerability Detail
    require(_reserve0 == _reserve1, "TWAPOracle: PAIR_UNBALANCED");
## Impact
 This is a strong assumption and may not always hold true, especially in volatile markets.
