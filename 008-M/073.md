# UbiquityPool::mintDollar/redeemDollar UbiquityPool does not keep track of minting/redemption fees

## Summary
When minting dollars or redeeming dollars, a fee is applied to be kept by the protocol. However there is no track of fees gathered by the contract by minting/redeeming, and these fees are still part of the freeBalance. This means the protocol will be unable to claim the fees associated to redeeming/minting 

## Vulnerability Detail
See in UbiquityPool::mintDollar (resp. redeemDollar) for the application of `mintingFee` (resp. `redeemingFee`):

The fees collected by the protocol are not kept track of, and are not discounted from the `freeCollateralBalance`:

This means that users are free to withdraw all DAI collateral, and the protocol won't be able to claim the fees collected in DAI.

## Impact
Protocol is losing the ability to claim collected fees

## Recommendation
Implement a variable `feeCollected` by collateral index, and remove fees collected from free balance to ensure the protocol will be able to claim the fee:
