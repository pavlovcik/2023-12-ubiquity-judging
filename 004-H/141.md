# Dollar token won't be pegged to 1 USD.

## Summary
Incorrect target set for the Dollar token. Won't be pegged to `$1`.
## Vulnerability Detail
The price of the Dollar token is pegged to the value of 1` 3CRV` token from the `DAI/USDC/USDT` pool. But currently, the 3CRV token is trading just below `$1.03`.

When minting or burning dollar tokens the contract uses the `getDollarPriceUsd()` function
```solidity
require(
    getDollarPriceUsd() >= poolStorage.mintPriceThreshold,
    "Dollar price too low"
);
```
```solidity
require(
    getDollarPriceUsd() <= poolStorage.redeemPriceThreshold,
    "Dollar price too high"
);
```

The function reads the price from the TWAP which returns the price of dollar tokens in `DOLLAR TOKENS/3CRV TOKENS` in the pool. So the goal is to peg the Dollar token to the `3CRV` token which trades higher than `$1`.
```solidity
function getDollarPriceUsd()
    internal
    view
    returns (uint256 dollarPriceUsd)
{
    // get Dollar price from Curve Metapool (18 decimals)
    uint256 dollarPriceUsdD18 = LibTWAPOracle.getTwapPrice();
    // convert to 6 decimals
    dollarPriceUsd = dollarPriceUsdD18
        .mul(UBIQUITY_POOL_PRICE_PRECISION)
        .div(1e18);
}
```

Marked as high as the goal of the protocol is to peg to 1 USD.
## Impact
Dollar token won't be pegged to `$1` but to `$1.03` as the 3CRV token is worth `~$1.03`

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Adjust the targets according to the 3CRV price. The price can be obtained by calling `get_virtual_price` on the `3CRV` pool located at the address `0xbEbc44782C7dB0a1A60Cb6fe97d0b483032FF1C7` on `mainnet`.
