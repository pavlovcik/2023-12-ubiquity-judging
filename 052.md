# Immutable functions of the Diamond contract can be erroneously modified if `_init` address it set to the diamond contract it self

## Summary
`_init` address can erroneously be set to the calling contract which is the diamond contract, meaning the diamond contract can update it's immutable functions erroneously or intentionally this would break the diamond contract functionality.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function initializeDiamondCut(
        address _init,
        bytes memory _calldata
    ) internal {
        if (_init == address(0)) {
            return;
        }
        enforceHasContractCode(
            _init,
            "LibDiamondCut: _init address has no code"
        );
        (bool success, bytes memory error) = _init.delegatecall(_calldata);
        if (!success) {
```
`_init`   checked if  address(0) then returns, if `_int` is set to the diamond contract it self  the `delegatecall` will be made back to the contract itself, the logic will proceed to modify immutable functions in the contract. 
This increases attack surface for an attacker if the proxy gets compromised an attacker can use this logic to render the contract usless by changing or removing important functions.

## Impact
Immutable functions of the Diamond contract can be erroneously or intentionally modified

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check if `_init` address isn't the diamond contract
