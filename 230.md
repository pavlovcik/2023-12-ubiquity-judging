# Wrong number for blocks in a week

## Summary
In a week number of blocks mined on eth currently are around 49500
## Vulnerability Detail
Code set number of blocks in week as following `diamondinit.sol`

```solidity
       // @note - this is wrong, number of blocks in a week is currently 49700
        ls.blockCountInAWeek = 45361;
```

Which leads to wrong calculations in whole project. 

And also we know this number can change in future with hardforks. 
## Impact
wrong calculation
