# Unhandled chainlink revert would lock all price oracle access

## Summary
The collateral token price will fail to update once the ChainLink price feed is blocked from visiting.
## Vulnerability Detail
A call to `latestRoundData` could potentially revert and make it impossible to query prices. Feeds cannot be changed after they are configured through the function `addCollateralToken()` so this would result in a permanent denial of service;

## Impact
The collateral token price will fail to update.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Surround the call to `latestRoundData()` with `try/catch` instead of calling it directly. When the call reverts, the catch block can be used to call a fallback oracle or handle the error in any other suitable way.
