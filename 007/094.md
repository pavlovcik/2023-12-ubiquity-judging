# Missing check if collateral already exists

## Summary

The [`addCollateralToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol#L629-L680) function can be used by the administrative user to add new collateral to be supported by the protocol. The issue is that the function does not verify if the given collateral has been already added. This breaks core invariants of the protocol where two indexes will be pointing to the same collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail

It is possible to add the same collateral address twice via `addCollateralToken` function.

1. Administrator adds collateral `DAI` via [`addCollateralToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol#L629-L680)
2. Administrator by accident adds `DAI` collateral again.
3. [Multiple arrays are polluted](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol#L639-L679) with the new collateral index.

## Impact

The impact is significant since its not possible to recover if administrator adds the same collateral address twice to the protocol. The functionality of the protocol allows to disable collateral via `toggleCollateral` function but that [disables the collateral address](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol#L808-L809) which disables collateral completely.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to add additional check to [`addCollateralToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol#L629-L680) function to ensure it is not possible to add the same collateral address twice.
