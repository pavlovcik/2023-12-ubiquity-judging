# In `addCollateralToken`, there is no existence check for `collateralAddress`, which may lead to overwriting.

## Summary

In `addCollateralToken`, there is no existence check for `collateralAddress`, which may lead to overwriting.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `addCollateralToken`, there is no existence check for `collateralAddress`, which may lead to overwriting. 

```solidity
function addCollateralToken(
    address collateralAddress,
    address chainLinkPriceFeedAddress,
    uint256 poolCeiling
) internal {
    UbiquityPoolStorage storage poolStorage = ubiquityPoolStorage();

    uint256 collateralIndex = poolStorage.collateralAddresses.length;

    // add collateral address to all collaterals
    poolStorage.collateralAddresses.push(collateralAddress);

    // for fast collateral address -> collateral idx lookups later
    poolStorage.collateralIndex[collateralAddress] = collateralIndex;
```

If `collateralAddress` is an existing address, the original `collateralIndex` will be overwritten, resulting in data inconsistency.

## Impact

data inconsistency

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check if `collateralAddress` is already in `poolStorage.collateralAddresses`.
