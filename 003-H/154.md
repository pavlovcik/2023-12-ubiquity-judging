# Time weighted average price is wrongly implemented

## Summary

Time weighted average price is wrongly implemented and can easily be manipulated.

## Vulnerability Detail

For twap to be resistant to price manipulation the observation window should be large enough
because it calculates averages price within this window. To manipulate such oracle you need 
to mantain manipulated spot price significant part of the observation window, which is 
considered very expensive if observation window and liquidity in pool is enough due to 
arbitrageurs constantly trying to bring price back for profit.

But in LibTWAPOracle implementation observation window it could be as little as 1 second.
(block time to be precise, on mainnet ~12 sec)

```solidity
// @issue this time window could be not enough to prevent manipulation
if (blockTimestamp - ts.pricesBlockTimestampLast > 0) {
    // get the balances between now and the last price cumulative snapshot
    uint256[2] memory twapBalances = IMetaPool(ts.pool)
        .get_twap_balances(
            ts.priceCumulativeLast,
            priceCumulative,
            // @issue using too short observation window
            blockTimestamp - ts.pricesBlockTimestampLast
        );
    
    ...
}
```

## Impact

Price can be easely manipulated. This could dos mint/redeem because of 
mintPriceThreshold/redeemPriceThreshold checks and harm other parts of protocol that uses twap oracle.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Curve pool do not store old observations for cummalative balances, only current values.
So i think you have to store them in your contract and then use for twap calculation at
least X seconds old observaation along with current from pool (something similar to uniswap
twap implementation with `observations` array)
