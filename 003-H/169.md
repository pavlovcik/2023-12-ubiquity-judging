# The TWAP interval is too short which makes manipulating the price easier

## Summary

The interval to get the TWAP of the Curve metapool is extremely short which makes oracle manipulation much easier and the price of uAD can be manipulated. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The TWAP oracle uses the Curve Metapool to get the price of uAD, lets take a look at the `update()` function:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/d9c39e8dfd5601e7e8db2e4b3390e7d8dff42a8e/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibTWAPOracle.sol#L74

```solidity
function update() internal {
        TWAPOracleStorage storage ts = twapOracleStorage();
        (
            uint256[2] memory priceCumulative,
            uint256 blockTimestamp
        ) = currentCumulativePrices();
        if (blockTimestamp - ts.pricesBlockTimestampLast > 0) {
           //price is updated
        }

```

As you can see here 1 block price is used as the TWAP window which makes the oracle a spot oracle and manipulation is much easier because proposing 2 blocks consecutively would be enough for the attacker to manipulate the price. 

## Impact

The attacker can abuse this to manipulate the price as he wants. The TWAP is used in many places like for example `LibCurveDollarIncentive.sol` so the attacker can manipulate the price and profit from this.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The TWAP Oracle should have a bigger interval because the manipulation cost increases with the size of the TWAP window. It should also be flexible to be readjusted according to market conditions.

```solidity
if (blockTimestamp - ts.pricesBlockTimestampLast > interval) {
      //price is updated
}
```
