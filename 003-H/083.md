# TWAP oracle easily manipulated.

## Summary
TWAP oracle easily manipulated.

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue lies in the fact that the periodSize is set to 0, indicating that the oracle takes a new observation every single block. This configuration allows potential attackers to flood the TWAP oracle easily, enabling them to manipulate the reported price.

## Impact
The vulnerability poses a significant risk of price manipulation, potentially leading to inaccurate and unreliable TWAP values.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability, it is strongly recommended to increase the periodSize to a value greater than 0. A standard value, such as 1800, is suggested. This adjustment will enhance the security of the TWAP oracle by reducing the frequency of observations and making it more resilient to manipulation.
