# The owner might remove selector DiamondCutFacet.diamondCut() and then the protocol loses upgradablity.

## Summary
The owner might remove selector DiamondCutFacet.diamondCut() and then the protocol loses upgradablity.

## Vulnerability Detail
The Ubiquity protocol uses the Diamond proxy to support upgradability of the protocol. There are two cases to add a facet:
1) When Diamond is first deployed, facets can be added via the constructor, in which the DiamondCutFacet and its selectors are added as well; 2) future facets cut are accomplished via DiamondCutFacet.diamondCut().

Therefore, it is important that DiamondCutFacet.diamondCut() will not be removed via itself. However, the following POC shows that the owner (either malicious, or stolen or by accident) might remove DiamondCutFacet.diamondCut().

```javascript
   function testDiamondCutFacet1() public {
        FacetCut[] memory facetCut = new FacetCut[](1);
        facetCut[0] = FacetCut({
            facetAddress: address(0),
            action: FacetCutAction.Remove,
            functionSelectors: selectorsOfDiamondCutFacet
        });

        vm.prank(owner);
        diamondCutFacet.diamondCut(facetCut, address(0x0), "");
    }
```

The following code shows that after removing, it is impossible to add it back due to the failing of calling diamondCutFacet.diamondCut(). The error message is that "the function does not exists"

```javascript
   function testDiamondCutFacet2() public {
        FacetCut[] memory facetCut1 = new FacetCut[](1);
        facetCut1[0] = FacetCut({
            facetAddress: address(0),
            action: FacetCutAction.Remove,
            functionSelectors: selectorsOfDiamondCutFacet
        });

        vm.prank(owner);
        diamondCutFacet.diamondCut(facetCut1, address(0x0), "");

        FacetCut[] memory facetCut2 = new FacetCut[](1);
        facetCut2[0] = FacetCut({
            facetAddress: address(diamondCutFacet),
            action: FacetCutAction.Add,
            functionSelectors: selectorsOfDiamondCutFacet
        });
        vm.prank(owner);
        vm.expectRevert();
        diamondCutFacet.diamondCut(facetCut2, address(0x0), "");
    }

```

Note the following line prevents the removel of a function from diamond.sol but not from DiamondCutFacet, which has a different address from Diamond (the proxy):

## Impact
The owner might remove selector DiamondCutFacet.diamondCut() and then the protocol loses upgradablity.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add code into  DiamondCutFacet.diamondCut() to check that  the argument ``_diamondCut`` does not contain the cut that will remove DiamondCutFacet.diamondCut().
