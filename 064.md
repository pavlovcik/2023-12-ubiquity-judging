# Not using a deadline parameter to safeguard mintDollar

## Summary
The `mintDollar` function inside `LibUbiquityPool.sol` takes `dollarOutMin` & `maxCollateralIn` as slippage protection parameters, but it lacks a `deadline` parameter, which is another important element to properly safeguard a trx from different MEV tactics(front/back running etc.)

## Vulnerability Detail
The usage of `dollarOutMin` & `maxCollateralIn` is a a good approach to protect the minter from unwanted slippage. However specifying a `deadline` input to execute a trx is another important safety measure that is commonly used in such scenarios ( most popular AMMs - like Uniswap for example).

`deadline` lets the caller specify a deadline parameter that enforces a time limit by which the transaction must be executed. Without a deadline parameter, the transaction may sit in the mempool and be executed at a much later time potentially resulting in a worse price for the user.

This also applies to `LibUbiquityPool.redeemDollar` as well.

## Impact
Because Front-running is a key aspect of trx operations that depend on some price value, deadline is a useful tool to ensure that your tx cannot be “saved for later”.

Due to the lack of the check, it may be more profitable for a validator to deny the transaction from being added until the transaction incurs the maximum amount of slippage.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-ubiquity/blob/main/ubiquity-dollar/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol#L326


```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Mints Dollars in exchange for collateral tokens
     * @param dollarOutMin Min amount of dollars to mint (slippage protection)
     * @param maxCollateralIn Max amount of collateral to send (slippage protection)
     */
    function mintDollar(
        uint256 collateralIndex,
        uint256 dollarAmount,// based on logic below should be 1e6
        uint256 dollarOutMin,
        uint256 maxCollateralIn
       //@audit -> no deadline provided
    )
        internal
        collateralEnabled(collateralIndex)
        returns (uint256 totalDollarMint, uint256 collateralNeeded)
    {
      ......
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `LibUbiquityPool.mintDollar()` & `LibUbiquityPool.redeemDollar()` functions should accept a user-input deadline param that should prevent the trx from sitting too long in the mempool

```solidity
 function mintDollar(
        uint256 collateralIndex,
        uint256 dollarAmount,// based on logic below should be 1e6
        uint256 dollarOutMin,
        uint256 maxCollateralIn
        uint256 deadline    <---------------------
    )
        internal
        collateralEnabled(collateralIndex)
        returns (uint256 totalDollarMint, uint256 collateralNeeded)
    {
      ......
     require(
            block.timestamp <= deadline,
            "Past the deadline"
        );
      .....

}
```
