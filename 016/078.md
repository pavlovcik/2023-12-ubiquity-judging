# `setIncentiveContract` uses wrong access control role

## Summary

The issue involves the inappropriate use of the `GOVERNANCE_TOKEN_MANAGER_ROLE` role for the access control check in the `setIncentiveContract` function instead of using the correct incentive manager role `INCENTIVE_MANAGER_ROLE`, so the incentive manager will not be able to call `setIncentiveContract` to update/set the `incentive` contract for any account.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability lies in the mismanagement of roles within the `setIncentiveContract` function. Specifically, the contract checks for the presence of the `GOVERNANCE_TOKEN_MANAGER_ROLE` role using the `accessControl.hasRole` function (checks if caller has that role). However, for setting the incentive contract, the correct role to be checked is `INCENTIVE_MANAGER_ROLE`. Failing to utilize the appropriate role may lead to unauthorized access to the function.

## Impact

The `INCENTIVE_MANAGER_ROLE` role will be unable to set/change the `incentive` contract for any `account`.

```solidity
/**
 * @notice Sets `incentive` contract for `account`
 * @notice Incentive contracts are applied on Dollar transfers:
 * - EOA => contract
 * - contract => EOA
 * - contract => contract
 * - any transfer global incentive
 * @param account Account to incentivize
 * @param incentive Incentive contract address
 */
function setIncentiveContract(address account, address incentive) external {
    //@audit the INCENTIVE_MANAGER_ROLE role should be used instead of GOVERNANCE_TOKEN_MANAGER_ROLE
    require(
        accessControl.hasRole(GOVERNANCE_TOKEN_MANAGER_ROLE, _msgSender()),
        "Dollar: must have admin role"
    );

    incentiveContract[account] = incentive;
    emit IncentiveContractUpdate(account, incentive);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is strongly recommended to update the role check within the `setIncentiveContract` function to use the `INCENTIVE_MANAGER_ROLE` role instead of the current `GOVERNANCE_TOKEN_MANAGER_ROLE`.
