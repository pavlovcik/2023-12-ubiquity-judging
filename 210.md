# `addAmoMinter` cannot be used in current state and will always revert

## Summary
`addAmoMinter` was taken from frax and in ubiquity context cannot be used. 
## Vulnerability Detail
`addAmoMinter` was taken from frax, but ubiquity has the different architecture of amo minter that is an EOA , and as sponsor confirmed they don't need the following line in `addAmoMinter`, and if deployed in its current state would need to upgrade the contracts as it will keep reverting.
```solidity
   uint256 collatValE18 = IDollarAmoMinter(amoMinterAddress)
            .collateralDollarBalance();
```

So functionality becomes useless and breaks the core functionality to be able to generate the yield. 


## Impact
Amo can't be added, and can't allocate assets for yeild.
